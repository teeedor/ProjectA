#This File will implement the collatz conjecture


#Generate a random large number
#If the number is even, split it in half
#If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
#Then check these two conditions again until the remaining number is 1
#Print out all the numbers that it goes through then show the final number
#of operations at the end

####Program####

#Generate random large number
#Between 100 and 1000

#FOR LOOP
#Check to see if the number is 1

#If not 1
    #Check to see if it is even
        #Do operation

    #if not even
        #Do operation

    #Keep running tally of numbers

#End of For loop

#print out message with umber of iterations and other information
